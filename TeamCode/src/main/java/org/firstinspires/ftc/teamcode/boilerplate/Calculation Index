Control:

inchespertickX: encoder's counts per revolution / circumference

inchespertickY: encoder's counts per revolution / circumference

SparkIMU:

otos.setAngularScalar: spin 10 times. Find the ratio it is off by.

otos.setLinearScalar: move forward 100 cm or more. bring back and find the ratio it is off by.
